Hi, everyone. If I ask you a question, that is do you know how much you spend last month, on your food, on your entertainment. And do you know the percise number you spend, and the percise percentages of each part.

Accounting ourself is one of many tips about personal finance. 

Today I will share you 5 tips on personal finance.

Tip number 1, Saving some money at first. Some people save money after they spend. A better way is spending should depend on how much you want to save at first. Be doing that, we have started a plan on personal finance.

# Rule 1.5, Giving your purchase willingness a frozen time. If I want to buy a new mobile today, I ask myself, whether it is necessary right now. Maybe I can still use my old one for a month. So I hold down my purchase willing, and if 30 days later, I still urge to own the new mobile phone, I will enjoy myself. But sometimes, after 30 days, the willing of purchase will fade out. So we save amount of money, and we can spend it on education or something necessary.

Tip #2, Plan some emergency money. If I lose my job tomorrow, I should have some money for my food until next job. And, we use insurance to transfer the loss of risk. If I get injured in accident or face healthy problem, I need the insurance to cover my medical care. (10%)

Tip #3, Accounting ourself. Write down the number we spend and catalog our spending. If I find that I spend a lot on entertainment last year, I can make a change on my financial plan.
# For instance, If you will pay the tuition fee of MSE next month, assuming it is 5000, and you can receive an payback which is 4000. And now you want to buy a new mobile phone cost 2000. According the accounting, you may choose a cheaper mobile cost 1000, and you save another 1000 for further tuition fee.

Tip #4, Put some money on investment depending on the risk level we can take. 
# Starting some simple investment. If you have account on bao.alipay.com, you are using an investment named money market fund, which has lower risk. Then, you may try another money market funds. And if you have knowledge on other types of investment, stock funds, bond ... In my opinion, it is worth for learning some knowledge on finance.

Tip #5, Keep learning. we use the financial knowledge to improve our financial ability. 
# If a child who commits a crime will cost the parent more than money.

That's all I want to share, so enjoy money, and enjoy learning. Thanks.
