Hi, everyone. If I ask you a question, that is do you know the number you spend last month. Are you able to answer this question right now, without check your bank accounts? Furthermore, do you know the exact number you spend on food last month, or on clothes, on transportation, on education? 

Accounting yourself is one of rules about personal finance. It can help us understand where the money went and predict where the money worthes to spend on.

Today I will share some tips / suggestions on personal finance, which you may read from any book on personal finance.

Rule number 1, Saving some money at first. Some people save money depending on how much they want to spend at first. A better way is spending should depend on how much you want to save in bank at first.
Spend = Income - Saving, instead of Saving = Income - Spend.
If we curry in this way, that means we start a plan on personal finance.

Rule 1.5, Giving your purchase willingness a frozen time. If I want to buy a new mobile today, I ask myself, whether it is necessary right now. Maybe I can still use my old one for a month. So I hold down my purchase willing, and if 30 days later, I still urge to own the new mobile phone, I will enjoy myself. But sometimes, after 30 days, the willing of purchase will fade out. So we save amount of money, and we can spend it on education or something necessary.

Rule 2, Preparing some emergency money. If I lose my job tomorrow, or get injured in some sudden accident. I must have some money for this emergency.

Rule 3, Buying an insurance for yourself and family. Insurance transports the risk. (10%)

Rule 4, Accounting on yourself. Write down the number your spend and record the number you receive. You can understand the cash flow, and if you find you spend a lot on entertainment last year, you can make a change on your financial plan.
For instance, If you will pay the tuition fee of MSE next month, assuming it is 5000, and you can receive an payback which is 4000. And now you want to buy a new mobile phone cost 2000. According the accounting, you may choose a cheaper mobile cost 1000, and you save another 1000 for further tuition fee.

Rule 5, Starting some simple investment. If you have account on bao.alipay.com, you are using an investment named money market fund, which has lower risk. Then, you may try another money market funds. And if you have knowledge on other types of investment, stock funds, bond ... 
In my opinion, it is worth for learning some knowledge on finance.

Rule 6, Investing on education of yourself, and your children. Not just what we learned in school, but also virtues we learn from our society. If a child who commits a crime will cost the parent more than money.

That's all I want to share, so enjoy money, and enjoy learning. Thanks.
