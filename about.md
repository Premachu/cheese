I code codes, and have been working on [Algo.js] [1] for one year.

I write posts and some CSS of this blog, with many help from these [frameworks](/credits).

I am working with the team that always inspire me.

I keep leaning from anywhere, including [Coursera] [2], [Udacity] [3], [XuetangX] [4], [MongoDB University] [5], etc.
