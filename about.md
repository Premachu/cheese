I code codes, and have been working on [Algo.js] [1] for one year.

I write posts and some CSS of this blog, with many help from these frameworks.

I am working with the team that always inspire me.

I keep leaning from anywhere, including [Coursera] [2], [Udacity] [3], [学堂在线] [4], [MongoDB University] [5], etc.

<div class="lang zh-cn">

我写代码。

我有热情学习。

我和出色的团队共事。
